# 🔍 What Is Telegram Number Checker?

Telegram Number Checker is a desktop-based automation tool that checks whether a phone number is registered on Telegram.

For every number checked, the tool automatically detects registration status and separates results into structured CSV files, making data handling simple and efficient.

It is especially useful for users who work with large phone number lists and need accurate verification without manual effort.

This tool is built for speed, stability, and large-scale number verification using multiple Telegram accounts with automatic rotation.

#
# ⚙️ How It Works

1. Add phone numbers to database.csv

2. Login Telegram accounts OR ( use .sessions + json )

3. The tool automatically checks each number

4. Results are saved in categorized CSV files

5. Checked numbers are removed automatically to avoid duplicates

Everything runs automatically after setup.
